# The Earth Light

Decompilation of KCE Japan West's "High Speed Robot Action" title *Zone of the Enders*.

## Overview

This project aims to construct a C/C++ language codebase that will compile working replacement code for PlayStation 2 and, if possible, match the original binary exactly.

New content not representative of the base games such as ports to new systems, enhancements, translations, etc. most likely will not be merged while the initial decompilation is ongoing. Please create a new fork of the project to do so. (This policy may be changed in the future.)
